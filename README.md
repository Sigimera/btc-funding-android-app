3. Start CrowdFunding!

## How does it work?

TODO: Describe here how the app can be used to manage crowdfunding campaigns offline and how the onine and offline mode works.

#### Why do I need no internet connection?

TODO: Describe here the mechanism that makes it possible to recreate the campaign structure, with related bitcoin addresses, without communication between mobile and server.

#### How can I keep my desktop and mobile version in sync?

1. By creating the same campaigns and number of bitcoin addresses on both devices. This is only necessary if your mobile device has no internet connection.
2. By automatic synchronisation: Done automatically if your mobile device has internet.
